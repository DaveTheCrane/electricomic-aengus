# electricomic-aengus
Demo electricomic based on the second adaptation of W.B. Yeat's "The Song of Wandering Aengus" from my book [Myths of this World](http://davethecrane.bigcartel.com). 

The two adaptations were very much conceived as a pair. [The first one](http://davecrane.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/wandering-aengus.html) was the "obvious" approach for Yeats, with lush photo-shoppy visuals, and a strong emotional element. [Version two](http://davecrane.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/wandering-aengus-returns.html) took a more cerebral, abstract look at the poem, starting up by examining it's structure, and breaking up the page into a grid, with each verse getting two rows of four panels. I then subdivided the panels with literal illustrations of each word. So we had a Romantic and a Classical approach, respectively. It sounds very serious and worthy, but there's a lot of bad puns and silliness in the second version.

I've picked it for my first Electricomic because I don't think it was successful as a one-page strip. Very few people have "got it", and I'd like to try telling it differently, in a more interactive way.

The base version of the comic, uploaded with the first commit, is just a panel-by-panel slideshow. I want to use it as a base to explore some of the following ideas:

* Responsive design/layout. Could we show the same story on a small screen (e.g. a phone) panel by panel, and maybe four panels at a time on a tablet or laptop?
* Can I make the puns more obvious by overlaying the words on top of the pictures somehow? What are the options here for interactively reading the poem?
* Can I introduce multiple views of the story, that the user gets to choose between?
* The poem's about wandering. Could I overlay it on a route in Google Maps?

...and probably other questions that haven't occurred to me yet.
